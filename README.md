Personal portfolio page built with React

---

### Tools Used

- create-react-app used to bootstrap the project
- Material UI for UI elements
- Material UI's makeThemes module for theming and styling
- Formspree for handling contact forms and forwarding information

### Goals

Although the main goal of any portfolio page is to show off completed projects and completed skills, I wanted to make this portfolio page a project in itself.

I've paid attention to building a responsive, polished design with solid interactive features.

Instead of hardcoding information and pages, I've used external Javascript objects to hold data. This makes the page easy to maintain and add to, in case I want to show off a new completed project or add another receipe to the bonus recipe page.
